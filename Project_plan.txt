Overall Plan
-------------

Use Terraform to build 2 EC2 instances of CentOS7 AMIs in AWS with appropriate subnets and public IP. One host to run Jenkins and the other one for application deployment.

Create a Git repository in git hub and place all the code.

Configure Jenkins to listen to git repo and use a docker compose file to build images of web, api and db. 
Jenkins use Ansible to upload the images to a docker hub preferably on-premise docker hub, however in this case private/public.
Jenkins make use of ansible playbook to deploy application stack on the other aws instance meant for the same. 


Room for improvement
--------------------

Instead of creating a single instance for application deployment, we can create a AWS load balancer and AWS kubernetes cluster and deploy the application. making it highly available and resilient.
